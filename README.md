Q-Next is a social music application that enables groups of people to contribute to a playlist which can then play through a single device. The concept for this application is very similar to [watchtogether](https://w2g.tv/?lang=en) or discord music bots. This application would be great for any moment that you can think of were you are listen to music with friends through a speaker. Everyone involved would be able to join the party with easy and enjoy music queued by others and introduce others to new music.
